# Vox Populi Platform
The evolution of surveys has made them an indispensable tool in fields such as marketing,
public opinion research, healthcare, education, and more.
Surveys have evolved from door-to-door surveys, to phone surveys, to digital platforms,
including online surveys, email surveys, and social media polls.
These advancements have greatly expanded the reach of surveys, allowing researchers to
gather data from a much larger and more diverse group of people in a fraction of the time it
would have taken with traditional methods, but at the same time, they have posed greater
risks for obtaining fake or unreliable data. The ease of access to surveys and the anonymity
provided by online platforms can make it easier for respondents to provide inaccurate or
false responses, either intentionally or unintentionally.

With the rapid development of technology, everyone nowadays is exposed to news from all
over the world and can share their opinions with others from the palm of their hands. The
rise of smartphones, social media platforms, and instant messaging has made it easier than
ever for individuals to access real-time information, engage in conversations, and participate
in global discussions. This data is ready to be used to create up-to-date, more accurate, and
more diverse surveys.

To harness this data in the most effective way, we are developing the E2EE (End-to-End
Encryption) Platform. With the VP Platform, the user could create a system which will
generate connections to the participants’ instant messaging apps (Whatsapp, Telegram and
Signal), manage the connections, feed a database constant data from chats of the
particiapte’s choosing and anonymize this data.
The VP Platform will solve the problems of out-of-date surveys, of misleading responses,
and of low participation rates.

Our platform is unique because of its ability to connect the user to apps with different types
of protocols, to give the user information about the collected data and about the participants
constantly, and it supports hebrew and hebrew anonymization.
We plan to use mainly Matrix protocol and LLMs to achieve our goal and to create a
management dashboard for the user in order to make use of our platform as easy and useful
as we can.
