# Vox Populi Platform

Final Year B.Sc. Project in Data Engineering, Ben-Gurion University.

## Overview

Surveys have long been a vital tool in fields such as marketing, healthcare, education, and public opinion research. While their evolution—from door-to-door interviews to digital polls—has made data collection faster and more scalable, it has also introduced new challenges: unreliable responses, outdated information, and low engagement rates.

The Vox Populi Platform is designed to revolutionize how we conduct surveys by tapping into real-time, user-consented messaging data. Leveraging end-to-end encryption (E2EE), instant messaging integrations, and advanced anonymization techniques, VP empowers researchers to gather high-quality, real-world insights—without compromising user privacy.

## Key Features

- Cross-Platform Messaging Integration with WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal.

- Real-Time Data Feed to continuously collect chat data from participants' chosen conversations.

- Smart Anonymization with built-in Hebrew support and NLP-based anonymization tools.

- Management Dashboard for an intuitive user experience to monitor data streams and participants.

## Why VPP?

Unlike traditional surveys, our platform allows:

- Real-time engagement with diverse and dynamic audiences.

- Passive, yet consensual, data collection to improve accuracy.

- Deep integration with encrypted protocols like Matrix.

- Seamless support for Hebrew, including Hebrew-specific anonymization using LLMs.

## Technologies Used

- Matrix Protocol for secure and decentralized messaging integration.

- NER Models & Regex for anonymization.

- Custom Dashboard for full user control and visualization.

- Cloud Database for managing continuous data streams.

## Use Cases

- Academic research with real-world chat data.

- Sentiment analysis from anonymous conversations.

- Real-time opinion polling without traditional survey fatigue.
